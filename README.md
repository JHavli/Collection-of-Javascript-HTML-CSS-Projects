BMI Calculator:

This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of a web page with an input form where users can enter their height and weight. Upon clicking the "Calculate BMI" button, the JavaScript code calculates the BMI value based on the entered values. The calculated BMI value is displayed in the corresponding input field, and a weight condition message is shown based on the calculated BMI value. The CSS styling is used to create a visually appealing and responsive layout for the calculator.

Random Picker:

The Random Picker project is a web application designed to help users make decisions when they have multiple options to choose from. Users can input their choices, such as different restaurant options, and the application will randomly select one for them. It provides a simple and convenient solution for making decisions in an interactive way.

ToDoList:

This project is a simple to-do list application implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user interface where users can add tasks to a list. The tasks are displayed as list items, and each item can be marked as checked or unchecked. The checked items have a strikethrough effect to indicate completion. Users can also delete tasks by clicking on a delete button associated with each task. The application uses local storage to store the tasks, allowing the list to persist even after refreshing the page. The styling and layout are designed to create an appealing and user-friendly interface for managing tasks. I designed the "todoicon.png" graphic myself in Adobe Illustrator.
